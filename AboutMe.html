                <h2>Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1402 – 10 July 1460)</h2>
                <p> Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham was an English nobleman
                    and a military commander who fought for the Lancastrian King Henry VI during the Wars
                    of the Roses, where he was killed at the Battle of Northampton. Through his mother he
                    had royal blood as a great-grandson of <em>King Edward III</em>, and from his father, he inherited
                    the earldom of Stafford. He joined the English campaign in France with King Henry V in 1420.
                    Following the king's death two years later, he became a councillor for the nine-month-old
                    King Henry VI. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the 1430s, when Humphrey, Duke of
                    Gloucester vied with Cardinal Beaufort for political supremacy. He took part in the
                    eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447. He was the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator
                    during Jack Cade's Rebellion of 1450. In 1455 he fought for the King in the first battle
                    of the Wars of the Roses, at St Albans, where they were both captured by the Yorkists.
                    He spent the last years of his life attempting to mediate between the Yorkist
                    and Lancastrian factions.</p>

                <h2>2019 FIFA Women's World Cup</h2>
                <p> The 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup was the eighth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup,
                        the quadrennial international football championship contested by 24 women's national
                        teams representing member associations of FIFA. It took place between 7 June and 7 July
                        2019, with 52 matches staged in nine cities in France,[1] which was awarded the right
                        to host the event in <strong>March 2015</strong>, the first time the country hosted the tournament. The
                        tournament was the first Women's World Cup to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system.
                        The United States entered the competition as defending champions after winning the 2015
                        edition in Canada, and successfully defended their title with a 2–0 victory over the
                        Netherlands in the final. In doing so, they secured their record fourth title and became
                        the second nation, after Germany, to have successfully retained the title.
